[OpenSceneGraph](http://www.openscenegraph.org/) 3D models assembling tool. This tool generates OpenSceneGraph compliant 3D models assembled from submodels like control surfaces, landing gear elements, etc. It can also enrich such a model with generic features like fully articulated helicopter rotor, runways and taxiways lighting systems, visual approach aids.

Runway Approach Lighting System (RALS) types include:

* Approach Lighting System with Flashing Lights (ALSF-I and ALSF-II)
* Medium Intensity Approach Lighting System (MALS)
* Medium Intensity Approach Lighting System with Sequenced Flashing Lights (MALSF)
* Medium Intensity Approach Lighting System with Runway Alignment Indicator Lights (MALSR)
* Luch-2MU SSP-1

Visual Glide Slope Indicator (VGSI) types include:

* Precision Approach Path Indicator (PAPI) P4
* Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI) V4
* Visual Approach Slope Indicator (VASI) V6
* Fresnel Lens Optical Landing System (FLOLS) - so called meatball
